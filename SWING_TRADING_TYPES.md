# Comprehensive Guide to Swing Trading Types

Swing trading involves holding positions for several days to weeks to capture a "swing" in price. Unlike day trading, it focuses on medium-term trends and volatility.

## 1. Trend Following (Trend Riding)
The most common form of swing trading. Traders look for assets in a clear uptrend or downtrend.
- **Entry:** Pullbacks to a moving average (e.g., 20-day or 50-day EMA).
- **Signal:** Bullish/Bearish engulfing patterns or RSI returning from oversold/overbought levels while the trend is intact.
- **Goal:** Capture 50-80% of a major price leg.

## 2. Mean Reversion (Counter-Trend)
Based on the theory that prices eventually return to their average.
- **Entry:** When price is "stretched" far from its moving average or touches Bollinger Band extremes.
- **Signal:** RSI > 70 (Overbought) or < 30 (Oversold).
- **Goal:** Capture the snap-back to the mean.

## 3. Breakout Trading
Focuses on price action when it "breaks" through a established level of support or resistance.
- **Entry:** Price closes above a high-volume resistance zone or a chart pattern (Cup & Handle, Flag).
- **Signal:** Increase in volume accompanying the price break.
- **Goal:** Ride the initial momentum of a new trend.

## 4. Range Trading
Effective in "sideways" markets where price oscillates between two clear horizontal levels.
- **Entry:** Buy at support, Sell at resistance.
- **Signal:** Oscillators like Stochastics or RSI showing reversals at the boundaries.
- **Goal:** Consistent small gains in a low-volatility environment.

## 5. Event-Driven Swing Trading
Trading based on specific catalysts like earnings, product launches, or macroeconomic shifts.
- **Entry:** Pre-event (anticipation) or Post-event (reaction).
- **Signal:** News sentiment, surprises in data (EPS beats, FOMC rate changes).
- **Goal:** Capture the volatility spike caused by news.

## 6. Fibonacci Retracement Trading
Uses mathematical ratios to find hidden support and resistance levels.
- **Entry:** Often at the 50% or 61.8% retracement levels.
- **Signal:** Price rejection at a Fibonacci level combined with technical indicators.
- **Goal:** Enter a trend at the optimal "discount" price.
