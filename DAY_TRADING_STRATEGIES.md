# Comprehensive Guide to Day Trading Strategies

Day trading involves opening and closing positions within the same trading day. Unlike swing trading, the goal is to capitalize on intraday price movements and avoid overnight risk.

## 1. Scalping
Scalping is the fastest trading style, where traders profit from very small price changes over seconds or minutes.
- **Entry:** High-frequency setups based on Level 2 market depth and order flow.
- **Signal:** Micro-breakouts or rapid bid/ask spread movements.
- **Goal:** Accumulate many small wins throughout the day.

## 2. Momentum Trading (Gap and Go)
Focuses on stocks that are moving significantly in one direction on high volume, often due to overnight news or earnings.
- **Entry:** Buying the "morning dip" after a gap up, or buying the breakout of the first 15-minute high.
- **Signal:** High relative volume (RVOL) and price proximity to the day's high.
- **Goal:** Ride the "fast money" momentum for 30 minutes to 2 hours.

## 3. Fade Trading (Contrarian)
Trading against the prevailing trend, usually after an exhaustive move.
- **Entry:** Price reaches an extreme intraday overextended level (e.g., 3 standard deviations from VWAP).
- **Signal:** Bearish/Bullish divergence on the 1-minute or 5-minute RSI.
- **Goal:** Capture the retracement or "profit-taking" pullbacks.

## 4. VWAP Trading (Volume Weighted Average Price)
VWAP is considered the "true" average price of the day and is used by institutional traders.
- **Entry:** Price crossing above or below the VWAP line.
- **Signal:** "VWAP Bounce" (using VWAP as support/resistance) or "VWAP Cross" (trend change).
- **Goal:** Enter trades alongside institutional flow.

## 5. Opening Range Breakout (ORB)
Uses the first 5, 15, or 30 minutes of the trading day to define a "range."
- **Entry:** A clean break above or below the range boundaries.
- **Signal:** Sustained volume at the edge of the range.
- **Goal:** Capture the primary trend direction for the morning session.

## 6. Pivot Point Trading
Uses mathematical calculations based on the previous day's High, Low, and Close to find intraday support and resistance.
- **Entry:** Bounces or breaks at levels like R1, R2 (Resistance) or S1, S2 (Support).
- **Signal:** Price action candles (Pin bars, Hammers) forming at specific pivot levels.
- **Goal:** Predictable turning points in a range-bound intraday market.

## 7. News Fading
The opposite of event-driven trading. Faders believe the initial market reaction to news is often an overreaction.
- **Entry:** Shortly after a news spike settles.
- **Signal:** Price fails to make new highs/lows despite continued news flow.
- **Goal:** Profit from the market "correcting" its emotional overreaction.
